# Design of Experiments (DoE) Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of Design of Experiments projects. This collection showcases a series of projects I completed during my final year of college as part of the MTH8301 course - Planning and Analysis of Experiments. Each project within this portfolio demonstrates the application of DoE principles to real-world scenarios, emphasizing statistical analysis, experimental design, and optimization techniques.

Thank you for visiting my Design of Experiments portfolio.
